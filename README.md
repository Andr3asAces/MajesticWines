# MajesticWines

In this project I am looking to find the best quality wine for valentines day. 

- Use scrappy to webscrape and download the data.

- Clean the data 

- Create a PowerBI report

Fun fact: Did you know Penfolds 'Grange 2017' worth almost 600 pounds? ( I bought the Dark Horse )

Note: The main file sits in winescraper>spiders>winespider.py
